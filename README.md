# firewall_simulation.py
A basic firewall script to block or allow certain IP addresses or ports.

The firewall_simulation.py script implements a simple firewall simulation in Python. 
The primary functions of the script are:

Blocking and Allowing IP Addresses:

block_ip(ip): Adds the specified IP address to the set of blocked IPs. Any IP in this set will be denied access.
allow_ip(ip): Adds the specified IP address to the set of allowed IPs. Any IP in this set will be granted access.

Checking Access:

check_ip(ip): Determines if an IP address is blocked, allowed, or has an unknown status. This function checks the IP against the blocked and allowed lists and returns an appropriate access status.

# Importance of Firewalls in Network Security

Firewalls are a critical component of network security. They serve as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. Hereâ€™s why they are important:

Access Control:

Firewalls enforce access control policies by allowing or blocking network traffic based on predefined rules. This helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.

Protection Against Attacks:

Firewalls can help protect against various types of cyberattacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and other malicious activities.
Traffic Monitoring:

Firewalls can monitor network traffic for suspicious behavior or patterns that might indicate a security threat. They can log traffic data for analysis and incident response.

Network Segmentation:

Firewalls can segment a network into different zones (e.g., DMZ, internal network) to isolate critical systems and reduce the risk of lateral movement by attackers.

How the Script Simulates Basic Firewall Rules
The script simulates basic firewall functionality by:

Maintaining Lists of IP Addresses:

The script uses two sets: one for blocked IP addresses and one for allowed IP addresses. This mirrors how firewalls maintain rules for traffic filtering.
Checking Access:

When an IP address attempts to access the network, the script checks if it is in the blocked or allowed list. This simulates the decision-making process of a firewall in allowing or denying access.

Logging and Reporting:

The script provides a simple output indicating whether each IP address is granted access, denied access, or has an unknown status.
